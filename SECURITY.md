## Reporting a Vulnerability
<!--
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
-->
In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the
"Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.
